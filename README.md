Interactive Web Calculator: Bridging Python Logic with Front-End Elegance üêç‚ú®
This project showcases the journey of transforming a fundamental command-line utility into an engaging, interactive web application. Initially conceived and developed as a Python-based calculator within a Jupyter Notebook environment, this endeavor served as a foundational exercise in core programming logic, encompassing arithmetic operations, robust error handling (e.g., ZeroDivisionError), and user input management.

The subsequent phase involved a strategic pivot to web development, meticulously crafting a responsive and aesthetically pleasing front-end using the trifecta of modern web technologies: HTML for semantic structure, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling) for a sleek and intuitive user interface, and JavaScript for dynamic client-side interactivity. This transition highlights a key aspect of full-stack development: abstracting core functionalities from the back-end (where the initial Python logic resided) and reimplementing them on the client-side to deliver an immediate and seamless user experience.

This calculator is more than just a functional tool; it's a practical demonstration of interoperability across programming paradigms and a testament to the versatility of fundamental computational principles. It represents a hands-on exploration of user interface design, event-driven programming, and the critical role of client-side scripting in modern web applications. The project underscores the ability to translate conceptual algorithms into tangible, user-friendly digital products, suitable for broad accessibility.
